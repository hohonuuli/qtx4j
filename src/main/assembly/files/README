To use the qtx4j API's, include the following jars on your classpath:
	mbarix4j
	slf4j-api
	vcr4j

In addition you will need to include a slf4j logger. Typically you just need to 
include one implementation like 'slf4j-jdk14-1.5.3.jar' on your classpath. Refer
to documentation at http://www.slf4j.org/
	
You will also need to have QuickTime for Java installed. On Windows, this is 
automatically installed if you run the QuickTime installer from Apple or if you
have installed iTunes. QuickTime for Java is already installed on all Mac OS X 
versions.
